# Movie recommender

This started out as an exercise for writing a [collaborative filtering
routine in
Python](https://github.com/wesbarnett/MachineLearning/blob/master/ex8/Anomaly%20Detection%20and%20Recommender%20Systems.ipynb),
based off of what I learned in Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course.
From there I decided to get an updated data set and make this into a
Flask application.

The application is in production [on my
website](https://movies.barnett.science) where you can try it out.

The web application is run in a Docker container using a base image I
created [here](https://github.com/wesbarnett/apache-flask).
