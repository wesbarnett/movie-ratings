# Movie recommender

This started out as an exercise for writing a [collaborative filtering
routine in
Python](https://github.com/wesbarnett/MachineLearning/blob/master/ex8/Anomaly%20Detection%20and%20Recommender%20Systems.ipynb)),
based off of what I learned in Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course.
From there I decided to update the data set and make
this into a Flask application.

The application is in production on my website at:

Enjoy!
